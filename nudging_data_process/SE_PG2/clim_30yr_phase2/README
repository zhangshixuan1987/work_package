This directory contains the E3SM clim (free-running) data for the machine learing training
The simulation is the so-called AMIP (Atmospheric only) simulation, meaning that the ocean 
coupling is turned off, and the sea surface temperature (SST) is prescribed with observations. 

The data is on Spherical Element (SE) grid, which is roughly 2deg horizonal resolution. Different from 
the 10-year data, this set of simulation was run from 1979 to 2014, which contains 34 years simulation
in total, our purpose is to apply the ML bias correction on this long period data and attempted to obtain
robust evaluation of the TC track forecasts with and without ML bias correction 

The free-running E3SM simulations are conducted without any constrains on model state. This dataset
archives the following variables at ever 3-hour:

1. 3-D model state of wind (U, V), temperature (T), and humidity (Q). These four variables are targets 
   to be corrected by nudging or machine learning model (online approach).  

2. 2-D model state of surface pressure (PS), surface temperature (TS) 
   wind at bottom model level (Ubot, Vbot), humidity at bottom model level (Qbot)
   temperature at bottom model level (Tbot), surface geopotential (PHIS = surface height * 9.8)  

3. 2-D model diagnostics of sea level pressure (PSL), 2-meter temperature (TREFHT),
   2-meter humidity (QREFHT)
