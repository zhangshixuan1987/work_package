This directory contains the E3SM nudged simulation data for the machine learing training
The simulation is the so-called AMIP (Atmospheric only) simulation, meaning that the ocean
coupling is turned off, and the sea surface temperature (SST) is prescribed with observations.

The data is on Spherical Element (SE) grid, which is roughly 2deg horizonal resolution. This set
of simulation was run from 2007 to 2017, which contains 11 years simulation in total. The first year
of data can be treated as model spin up, and the remaining 10-year data are considered as the data to
be used by the ML model training.  The simulation period is the same as the period for nudged E3SM
simulation as this set of simulation is our Baseline for the nudged or ML bias corrected simulations.

The nudged E3SM simulations are conducted by constraining model 3-D model state variables towards observations.
The ERA5 reanalysis data is selected as the best estimates for observations. 
This dataset archives the nudging correction tendencies:

1. Nuding tendencies for 3-D model state of wind (U, V), temperature (T), and humidity (Q). 
   These four variables are targets output by nudging or to be learned by machine learning model (online approach). 
   We add "Nudge_" in front of each variable name indicate that the variables are for "nudging tendency"  

2. Nuding tendencies for 2-D surafce wind (U,V at 10-meter), temperature (T at 2-meter ), humidity (Q at 2-meter)

3. Nudging tendencies for 2-D surface radiative fluxes (shortwave and longwave radiation), 
   surface latent heat fluxes (due to evaporation), and 
   surface sensible heat flux (the transfer of heat caused by the difference in temperature between the sea and the air)
 
Note: all variable are model output averaged over 3-hour period. The variables in the second and third bullets only exist for simulations of E3SMv2_NDGUVTQ_SRF1_tau6 and E3SMv2_NDGUVTQ_SRF2_tau6

Size of the data (time x lev x ncol) = 2920 x 72 x 21600. 
Note: 2920 = 365 x 8 (i.e. 3hourly data throught the 1-year period)

There are five data with different configurations and strategies for nudging:
     a. E3SMv2_NDGUV_tau6:  E3SMv2 with nudging towards 3-D wind (U, V) from reference 
     b. E3SMv2_NDGUVT_tau6: E3SMv2 with nudging towards 3-D wind (U, V) and temperature (T) from reference
     c. E3SMv2_NDGUVTQ_tau6: E3SMv2 with nudging towards 3-D wind (U, V) and temperature (T) and humidity (Q) from reference.  
     d. E3SMv2_NDGUVTQ_SRF1_tau6: E3SMv2 with nudging towards 3-D wind (U, V) and temperature (T) and humidity (Q) from reference, as well as 2-D surafce wind (U,V at 10-meter), temperature (T at 2-meter ), humidity (Q at 2-meter), surface radiative fluxes (shortwave and longwave radiation).  
     e. E3SMv2_NDGUVTQ_SRF2_tau6: E3SMv2 with nudging towards 3-D wind (U, V) and temperature (T) and humidity (Q) from reference, as well as 2-D surafce wind (U,V at 10-meter), temperature (T at 2-meter ), humidity (Q at 2-meter), surface radiative fluxes (shortwave and longwave radiation), surface latent heat fluxes (due to evaporation), and surface sensible heat flux (the transfer of heat caused by the difference in temperature between the sea and the air)
